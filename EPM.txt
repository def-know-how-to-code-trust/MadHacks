NVIM controls
I understand. Neovim can be overwhelming at first. Here's a condensed list of essential commands to get you started:

1. Open a file: `nvim filename`

2. Modes:
   - Enter Insert mode: `i`
   - Exit Insert mode to Normal mode: `Esc`

3. Saving and Quitting:
   - Save: `:w`
   - Quit: `:q`
   - Save and quit: `:wq`
   - Quit without saving: `:q!`

4. Navigation (in Normal mode):
   - Move: Arrow keys or `h` (left), `j` (down), `k` (up), `l` (right)
   - Start of line: `0`
   - End of line: `$`
   - Next word: `w`
   - Previous word: `b`

5. Editing (in Normal mode):
   - Delete line: `dd`
   - Copy line: `yy`
   - Paste: `p`
   - Undo: `u`
   - Redo: `Ctrl + r`

6. Search:
   - Find: `/searchterm` then Enter
   - Next occurrence: `n`
   - Previous occurrence: `N`

7. Replace:
   - Replace all occurrences: `:%s/old/new/g`

Remember, you need to be in Normal mode (press `Esc`) before using most of these commands. Start with these basics and gradually add more as you get comfortable. Would you like me to explain any of these in more detail?
